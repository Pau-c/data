The goal of this project is to update the survey commissioned by the US government during the Vietnam war to investigate university students' attitudes toward campus protests that took place during that time. The commission's objective was to analyze the causes of unrest, identify patterns, and make recommendations for preventing or addressing similar situations in the future.  

Based on the instructions that accompany the original file, it is possible to determine how to parse the file so that it can be analyzed using python. The survey originally was conducted using an **IBM 360** machine, which used punched cards as an input method. These cards were made of stiff paper with holes punched in specific locations, each hole representing a bit of data.
The original file looked like this:
